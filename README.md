# 🧩 N-Queens Visualization (Backtracking)

This project is a **Python Tkinter-based visualization** of the classic **N-Queens Problem**, developed by **Sachin Singh**.  
It visually demonstrates how the **backtracking algorithm** works to solve the N-Queens challenge — placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## 🎯 Features
- 🪄 **Dynamic Board Size:** Choose N between 4 and 20.
- ⏱️ **Adjustable Speed:** Control the animation delay (in milliseconds).
- 👑 **Visual Steps:** Watch queens being placed and removed in real-time.
- 🧠 **Stop on First Solution:** Option to pause when a valid configuration is found.
- 🔁 **Reset Anytime:** Restart visualization instantly.
- 🎨 **Simple & Modern Interface:** Built entirely with Tkinter.

## 🧮 About the N-Queens Problem
The **N-Queens Problem** asks:
> How can we place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other (no same row, column, or diagonal)?

This program uses a **backtracking approach** — a recursive search that explores possible placements, backtracks when conflicts occur, and continues until all solutions are found.
